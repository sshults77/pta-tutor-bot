Instructor Notes:
Beneficence is the ethical principle that emphasizes doing the best for the patient. It means that healthcare providers have a duty to promote the health and welfare of the patient above other considerations. For PTs and PTAs, it means that they are bound to act in the patient’s best interests in physical therapy clinical practices. 
Nonmaleficence is the ethical principle that exhorts practitioners not to do anything that causes harm to the patient. 
Justice is an ethical principle that states that a healthcare provider distributes fair and equal treatment to every patient. In the context of receiving health care in general, justice requires that everyone receives equitable access to the basic health care necessary for living a fully human life. Veracity is an ethical principle that binds the healthcare provider and the patient in a relationship to tell the truth.
Confidentiality is an ethical principle that requires a healthcare provider to maintain privacy by not sharing or divulging to a third party privileged or entrusted patient information. Matters discussed by the patient with the healthcare provider in confidence are held secret except for rare instances when the information presents a clear threat to the well-being of the patient or another person or when the health of the public may be compromised.

Instructor Notes:
Autonomy is an ethical principle that in health care means a form of personal liberty or self-governance. The principle of respect for patient autonomy acknowledges the right of a patient to have control over his or her own life (including the right to decide who should have access to his or her personal information). The patient is free to decide to act upon his or her decisions, and his or her decisions have to be respected. 
APTA’s position states that the individual referred or admitted to the physical therapy service has rights, which include but are not limited to the following:4
• Selection of a PT of one’s own choosing to the extent that it is reasonable and possible
• Access to information regarding practice policies and charges for services
• Knowledge of the identity of the PT and other personnel providing or participating in the ­program of care
• Expectation that the referral source has no financial involvement in the service. If that is not the case, knowledge of the extent of any financial involvement in the service by the referring source
• Involvement in the development of anticipated goals and expected outcomes and the selection of interventions
• Knowledge of any substantial risks of the recommended examination and intervention
• Participation in decisions involving the physical therapy plan of care to the extent reasonable and possible
• Access to information concerning his or her ­condition
• Expectation that any discussion or consultation involving the case will be conducted discreetly and that all communications and other records pertaining to the care, including the sources of payment for treatment, will be treated as confidential
• Expectation of safety in the provision of services and safety in regard to the equipment and physical environment
• Timely information about impending discharge and continuing care requirements
• Refusal of physical therapy services
• Information regarding the practice’s mechanism for the initiation, review, and resolution of patient/client complaints

Instructor Notes:
The third principle of the patient’s bill of rights states that patients have the right to receive information from their certified healthcare provider to make an informed consent prior to the start of any procedure and/or treatment. The informed consent includes such information as the medically significant risks involved with any procedure and probable duration of incapacitation and, where medically appropriate, alternatives for care or treatment. Informed consent is the process by which a fully informed patient can participate in choices about his or her health care.
Elements of informed consent to be discussed with the patient/client include:
• The nature of the decision or the procedure (such as a clear description of the proposed intervention) 
• Reasonable alternatives to the proposed intervention
• The relevant risks, benefits, and uncertainties related to each alternative
• Assessment of patient understanding
• The patient’s acceptance of the intervention

Instructor Notes:
The APTA has developed ethical principles to assist PT and PTA members in their understanding of how to act morally and professionally. In addition, the APTA’s ethical principles can help PTs and PTAs to:
• Identify and clarify moral issues9
• Evaluate moral reasons and form moral viewpoints
• Acquire awareness of alternative viewpoints9
• Strengthen attitudes of care and respect for patients/clients and oneself
• Maintain integrity and act in morally responsible ways9
The standards promote the following seven ethical principles for PTAs: 
• Provide respectful and compassionate care for the patient, including sensitivity to individual and cultural differences
• Act on behalf of the patient/client while being sensitive to the patient’s/client’s vulnerability
• Work under the direction and supervision of the PT
• Comply with laws and regulations governing physical therapy
• Maintain competence in the provision of selected physical therapy interventions
• Make judgments commensurate with one’s educational and legal qualifications
• Protect the public and the profession from unethical, incompetent, and illegal acts

Instructor Notes:
There are seven core values that represent physical therapist professionalism. As a member of the physical therapy team, the physical therapist assistant must also be receptive to these values. As an active participant in the professional physical therapy environment, the PTA must employ values for self-assessment, critical reflection, and professional behaviors and attitudes in relation to their colleagues, patients/clients, other professionals, the public, and the profession. 
In 2009, the American Physical Therapy Association’s board of directors created a task force to identify specific characteristics that would be appropriate for the physical therapist assistant to display. Their work created the eight value-based behaviors for the physical therapist assistant.13
1. Altruism
2. Caring and compassion
3. Continuing competence
4. Duty
5. Integrity
6. PT/PTA collaboration
7. Responsibility
8. Social responsibility
