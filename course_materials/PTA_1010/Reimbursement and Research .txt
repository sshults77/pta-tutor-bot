Instructor Notes:
Reimbursement terminology is significant in physical therapy clinical practice:
• The patient is considered the first party. The physical therapist (PT), as the healthcare professional delivering physical therapy services, is considered the second party. The insurer is the third party. 
• The insurer is also considered the payer that makes payment for services under the insurance coverage policy.
• The term capitation means a reimbursement method that pays the provider a set fee each month, based on the number of patients enrolled in the insurance plan. A capitated payment is a form of reimbursement for healthcare services in which a healthcare provider is paid a predetermined (fixed) amount for each patient enrolled in his or her care. Capitation and capitated payment are terms used mostly by managed care organizations (MCOs). 
• Fee-for-service payment is a payment for specific healthcare services that were provided to a patient. The payment can be made by the patient or by an insurance carrier. As opposed to the capitated payment, a fee-for-service payment means that when a procedure was performed, a fee was charged, and the fee was paid by the insurance company. In the past, physical therapists were reimbursed for 100% of the billed procedures. The current healthcare market has caused insurance companies to reimburse only a percentage of the total bill.
• Managed care means a variety of methods of financing and organizing the delivery of health care in which costs are contained by controlling the ­provision of benefits and services. Physicians, ­hospitals, and other healthcare agencies contract with the managed care system to accept a predetermined monthly payment for providing services to patients enrolled in a managed care plan. The enrollee’s access to health care is limited to the physicians and other healthcare providers who are affiliated with the plan. Clinical decision making is influenced by a variety of administrative incentives and constraints (specific rules and regulations).
• A health maintenance organization (HMO) is a prepaid healthcare program of group practice that provides comprehensive medical care, especially preventive care, whose main goal is to control healthcare expenditures. A preferred provider organization (PPO) is similar to an HMO; however, it allows patients to choose out-of-network providers but will not pay 100% of those charges.12 
• Copayment is a monetary amount to be paid by the patient to healthcare professionals each time a service is provided. Deductibles are portions of a healthcare costs that the patient must pay prior to getting benefits from the insurance company. For example, a deductible of $1,000 means that the patient will pay the first $1,000 of healthcare costs and the insurance company will then begin assisting with healthcare bills.
• Denial means a refusal by an insurer to reimburse for services that have been rendered. 
• Eligibility is the process of determining whether a patient qualifies for benefits on the basis of factors such as enrollment date, preexisting conditions, and valid referrals.
• Prior authorization is a procedure required by some healthcare insurers that requires that the patient or healthcare provider contact the insurer to approve procedures or health care. Examples of activities that require preauthorization are surgical procedures or physical therapy services. In addition, some insurers limit the number of visits that can be provided in a calendar year or per diagnosis.12
• The term CPT 2014 stands for Current Procedural Terminology 2014. The CPT is a list of descriptive terms that contains five-character, numeric codes assigned to nearly every healthcare service. When billing occurs, healthcare providers must choose a CPT code that identifies the services provided.13 An example of a CPT code is 97530, which represents therapeutic activities, or 97110, which represents therapeutic exercise.
• ICD-9-CM refers to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. These codes create a standardized classification of diagnoses across all healthcare setting and providers. Healthcare insurers require that ICD-9 codes be identified during billing. On October 1, 2015, the ICD-9 codes used to report diagnoses and inpatient procedures are scheduled to be replaced by ICD-10 codes.14
